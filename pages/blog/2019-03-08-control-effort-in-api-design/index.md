Building graphical user interfaces is hard.

One of the reasons is poor API design. Specifically poor balance of
*control* vs *effort* over a set of use cases. Effort is the time it
takes to implement a use case using an API. Control is how fine-grained
the commands that we send to an API can be.

This issue of balance is not GUI-specific, it's a generic problem in API
design. This post is my attempt to understand the dynamics between control
and effort using examples from frontend development.


## The lost art of geometry

Here's a puzzle. Let's say we have two rectangles. One is taller and wider
than the other. We want to place and vertically center the smaller
rectangle inside the larger one.

The height of the larger rectangle is `h1`. The height of the smaller one
is `h2`. How do we solve for `x`, where `x` is the vertical offset of one
rectangle against the other?

![Puzzle: center a rectangle][img-ex1]

In case you'd like to take a shot at it, here are a few options:

```
1. x = h1 / 2
2. x = (h1 - h2) / 2
3. x = (h1 + h2) / 2
```

<Details summary='See the answer'>

```
2. x = (h1 - h2) / 2
```

</Details>

You see, it's only one line of Math -- that old unsexy programming language
of spreadsheets.

If we transfer this problem from the world of forms into the world of HTML
documents, it's still solvable. This time with CSS -- that new cool
styling language of browsers.

```
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
```


### A slightly harder puzzle

Let's make it a titbit harder. Now we'd like to tie the upper side of the
smaller rectangle to a grid. The rest is the same. We are still centering
the smaller box within a larger one, only this time rounding the value of
`x` to the closest grid row.

The height of a grid row is `h3`.

![Puzzle: center a rectangle within a grid][img-ex2]

Here are the options:

```
1. x = h3 * round((h1 - h2) / (2 * h3))
2. x = h3 * (h1 - h2) / 2
3. x = h3 * floor((h1 + h2) / 2)
```

<Details summary='See the answer'>

```
1. x = h3 * round((h1 - h2) / (2 * h3))
```

</Details>

The solution is more complex this time, but it's still Math and it's still
just one line. How would we do this with CSS? With iOS AutoLayout? Android Layout?

Sadly, there's no way.

### Who's got the rhythm?

Those puzzles were inspired by real-world use cases for GUIs. The last
one is a model of [Vertical rhythm,][vert-rhythm] a concept from
typography.

![Vertical rhythm][img-vert-rhythm]

Why is it so hard to implement? After all, we're just arranging pixels on
a screen. Pixels are squares. Squares are geometric shapes that we
should be able to manipulate with ease. But we can't.

### A pixel is not a pixel

The problem is that a pixel on the screen is represented by something else
in the system. It's a DOM element, a View, an Object. It's a thousand
different things. What a pixel *actually is* is hidden from a developer.

![Browser's render pipeline][img-render-pipeline]

In case of a browser it leads to all sorts of inconveniences:

* We are limited to the use cases that browser vendors consider
  common;
* We can't write tests for layout or paint stages of rendering;
* Testing anything UI-related requires *spinning off a browser.* It's like
  going groceries shopping on a private jet.

## The wrong tradeoff

At the beginning of the article I said that the core issue here is:

> Poor balance of control vs effort over a set of use cases.

Let's unpack that statement.

The set of use cases of an API is everything a dev might want to
implement. Browser vendors give us abilities to make GUIs. Any interface
we might want to build is included in the set of use cases. It's a large
set.

Effort is the time it takes to implement a use case using an API. The
more time it takes (for the person who already knows how the API works)
the harder it is to use.

What I mean by "control" is how fine-grained the commands that we send to
an API can be. In a graphics API, the levels of control could vary from
changing properties of a component to changing properties of a shape to
manipulating a pixel.

Amount of control we have is often determined by the level of abstraction
we're working with. The lower the abstraction the closer to hardware we
are the more control we have.

![Level of Abstraction vs Effort relationship for different kinds of use cases][img-effort-abstraction-graph]

It might seem that these two parameters, effort and control, are in direct
conflict. The more control we have the more work we have to do. That is
true, but it's not all the truth.

As we move through the set of use cases the effort/control relationship
changes. Showing one paragraph of text on a screen is easy to do with
high-level browser APIs. It's more and more effortful as we use lower
level abstractions. Imagine coding a shader that draws characters of a
given font.ðŸ˜±

Now let's remember the example with the grid at the beginning of the
article. Some use cases are plain impossible with high-level abstractions.
Until API vendors consider a use case like that common enough, there's no
way we can implement it. At the same time, it's not hard to make it using
a high-control low-level API like OpenGL.

We're slowly approaching the topic of API design. What are our options as
a system designer when we face these kinds of tradeoffs? One obvious choice
would be to prioritise one part of the equation over the other.

## #UseThePlatform

Historically browser vendors prioritized minimizing effort over a set of
common use cases. Browsers were decent at displaying documents with text
and images on a desktop screen.

![Browser API as a flat surface][img-browser-api-1]

Issues began when publishers and developers started asking for more.
Supporting several platforms, different screen resolutions and densities.
Building apps, games and other interactive media. It all required giving
more access, more *control* to the makers.

![Browser API as a cheese][img-browser-api-2]

That led us into the situation we are in today. There's that flat API for
common cases with a bunch of "holes" drilled into it to get to the
lower-level functionality browsers have (and had for a while).

That's why we can draw arbitrary shapes on an HTML canvas, but we can't
make those shapes a proper part of DOM, CSSOM or AOM (Accessibility Object
Model).

We can use different layout models like flexbox or grid. But there's no way
we can unit-test the results of a layout stage.

We can to some degree control what a browser stores in its cache, but we
can not save, retrieve and manipulate file contents in our code. At some
point, we will be able to do that thanks to the File API. But it would be a
separate construct, on a side, not related to Cache, Service Workers,
Application Cache and other APIs. Even though all of those *have the same foundation lower down the stack.*

![Browser API vs Browser insides][img-browser-api-3]


## The hard way

Prioritizing either effort or control is one way to solve this conflict.
There's another way. The much harder way.

As designers of an API we can decide to expose it in layers. To give
access to both low-level and high-level primitives. The tricky part is to
do it in a way where a developer can mess around with a lower-level API
without the result being "excluded" from the rest of the system.

[Flutter][flutter] is a good example of that kind of approach. Flutter is
a cross-platform mobile development platform made by Google.

![Flutter architecture][img-flutter]

Because of the layered structure of the Flutter API we are able to:

* Make a widget that is responsible for laying out its children;
* Unit-test our custom layout widget *without starting an emulator*;
* Make a widget with a custom paint method. For example, we can make a
  button with a custom shape, interesting shadow or coloring effect;
* That custom widget will still remain a button in terms of gestures it
  accepts, accessibility and other properties;
* We could unit-test the paint operation too. Again, just by running the
  code in a Dart VM, no emulator required.

Going back to our grid example from the top of the article. Here's the
code of the widget that centers its children vertically, tying them to a
grid:

```dart
Offset getPositionForChild(
  Size containerSize,
  Size childSize
) {
  final h1 = containerSize.height;
  final h2 = childSize.height;
  final h3 = rowHeight;
  final rowsCount = ((h1 - h2) / (2 * h3)).round();
  return Offset(0, rowsCount * h3);
}
```

As you can see, the code in Flutter looks very similar to what we came
up with using Math: `x = h3 * round((h1 - h2) / (2 * h3)).` That's another
benefit of working on the right level of abstraction: the way we express
our intention is straight-forward.

Here's how the resulting app in Flutter looks like:

## Closing thoughts

These principles of effort-vs-conflict, layered-vs-flat helped me solve
some of the recurring issues in my work. It's a useful lens to look
through.

Sometimes we get caught up "drilling" our flat high-level API to extract
the functionality that is burried underneath. That's the sign that we might
need to change our approach. Remember there's *a much larger set of use
cases* that we might be able to support with a lower-level API.
Extracting each use case one by one leads to bloated design and *more
work* from you as an API designer.
