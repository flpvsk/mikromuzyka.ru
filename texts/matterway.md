Making software at work usable.

With Matterway we developed a technology that allows customers to build
ergonomic applications on top of their existing systems of record. Fast.

I joined the company early on and helped define and implement the product.
By the time I left, Matterway had raised two rounds of funding and 30% of
DAX companies were our customers or doing pilots with us.
